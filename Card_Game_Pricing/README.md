# How much would you pay to play this card game?
I shuffle a deck of cards (with an equal number of red and black cards) and start dealing them face up. \
\
After any card you can say STOP, at which point I pay you $1 for every red card dealt and you pay me $1 for every black card dealt. \
\
What is your optimal strategy, and how much would you pay to play this game?
